##Green & Delicious

#### Behind “Green&Delicious” discover the story of Sam and Joe, a married couple, who decided to take care of themselves through a healthy lifestyle and better nutrition. At the beginning it was just a fun journey for two, then they became parents of 5 children. As they grew up, they had fun helping in the kitchen and discovering new tastes and flavors. As adults they decided to create a space, where good food and great time could be joined together. 2 of them were physically disabled, that's why they had to brainstorm about an accessibility free place for everybody. Their children and grandchildren decided to develop and extend the restaurant. People liked the concept and it later became this big restaurant that is well known today. As you can see, while you are enjoying your meal, your children can either eat with you or play in a special room just for them here. Near to the daily menu you have access to a various colored and delicious buffet and a take and go service. 

##### Meals and drinks are originally homemade according to our great grandparents' recipes. We will love to welcome you at our restaurant, discover, enjoy and rejoin the vegan lifestyle.
